      <p class="content">API, or application programming interfaces, as defined by Wikipedia, is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. It is essentially an interface that allows one program to be featured or used by another computer program with the complex inner workings behind it abstracted away.</p>
      <p class="content">A Web API is an API for the web browser or server. It’s like a library consisting of “official” data made available for references by major businesses and organizations. When you make a call to one of their methods, the providers will manage the permission and security and send back the database search results. Businesses like APIs because of the inadvertent growth opportunities, and developers like them, because, well, it’s a convenient open source tool that helps prevent the inventing of the wheel everytime.</p><br>

      <p class="content">So why Google Books Search Data API?</p>
      <p class="content">Because it’s the most extensive book database to date with over 25 million titles to browse from. Google Books is the driving force behind the Amazon-acquired book lovers community Goodreads.com and a number of UC Libraries, among many others. By accessing their library, not only do you gain access to relevant book data but users' bookshelves and reviews as well.</p>
      <p class="content">By clicking on the link above, you can trace back to the official documentation provided by Google. The information is plentiful but can be overwhelming to sort through. The most basic procedure of searching, extracting, and using that data is, thus, simplified in the following pages.</p><br>
